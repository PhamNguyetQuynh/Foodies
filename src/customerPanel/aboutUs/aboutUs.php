                    <div class="a">Chef Antonio was born and raised in the small town of Amalfi, Italy, where he grew up surrounded by the
                            fresh seafood and seasonal produce that have become the hallmarks of his cuisine. His passion for cooking
                            began at a young age, when he would spend hours in his grandmother's kitchen learning the secrets of
                            traditional Italian recipes. Chef Antonio is passionate about creating a warm and welcoming dining
                            experience for his guests. He invites you to come and taste the authentic flavors of Amalfi at his
                            restaurant, where he will take you on a culinary journey through the heart of Southern Italy.</div>
